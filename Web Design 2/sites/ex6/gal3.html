<h1>W3 Schools has a very simple CSS Gallery that looks nice and performs well.</h1>
  I was impressed by the simplicity of the design and ease of use - so much so, I used it for my last website I designed for the class.<br><br>

  The advantage is that it can be used with a lot more versitility than some of these others (lightbox and slidesJS), since it deosn't rely on complex JS functions that make the other two work. It's incredibly easy to understand, and even write from scratch.

  The difficulty is that often, it doesn't look as nice because of the workarounds you need to do in order to make it function. It's also not the best at handling animations, so unless you're okay with eternal fades, you might want to consider something else.
